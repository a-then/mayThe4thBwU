# May the 4th be with you - A Yoda Tribute

 Here's a CRUD program paying homage to the wisdom of Yoda. I could have not found a better time to do this!
 
 This program allows users to add quotes to a MongoDB database, with additional features to replace Yoda's quotes with Darth Vader's quotes and delete Darth Vader's quotes one by one.
